Password Strength Checker
A lightweight and efficient tool designed to analyze and evaluate the security of passwords. This application uses mathematical entropy and heuristic patterns to determine how resilient a password is against common cyber attacks.

🚀 Overview
This repository provides a tool that goes beyond simple character counting. It calculates the Information Entropy of a string to provide a realistic score of its strength, helping users move away from predictable patterns.

✨ Key Features
1)Real-time Entropy Calculation: Uses Shannon entropy principles to measure password unpredictability.
2)Pattern Recognition: Detects common sequences (e.g., 12345, qwerty) and repeated characters.
3)Comprehensive Feedback: Categorizes passwords into four tiers: Weak, Fair, Good, and Strong.
4)Diversity Analysis: Checks for the presence of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.
